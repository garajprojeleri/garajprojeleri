👋 Hi, I’m Ayşegül
I’m a research psychologist based in Turkey, now learning how to make small mobile games and apps — one project at a time.

I recently published my first mobile puzzle game Pixel Puzzle on the Play Store and I’m currently exploring game design with a focus on intuitive interactions, simple mechanics, and meaningful play.

While I’m still at the very beginning of this journey, I’m committed to learning by building — experimenting, failing, improving, and moving forward step by step.

🎯 What I’m Exploring
Mobile game development with Flutter
Puzzle mechanics & clean UI
Human-centered design principles
Playful interactions, small joys

📍 Current Project
🧩 Pixel Puzzle – My first mobile game published on Google Play

💬 Let’s Connect
If you're also learning, building, or just starting something from scratch — I’d love to connect and share the journey.
